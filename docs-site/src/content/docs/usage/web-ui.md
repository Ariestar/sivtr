description: Browse and search the unified local archive in a browser with `sivtr web`.
---

`sivtr web` serves a local web UI and a read-only JSON API over the unified archive (`archive.db`). Use it to browse terminal and agent sessions and to run full-text search ranked by BM25 relevance without opening the TUI.

## Start the server

```bash
sivtr web
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8080> in a browser.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--port <PORT>` | TCP port to bind (default `8080`) |
| `--host <HOST>` | Loopback bind address (default `127.0.0.1`). Non-loopback values are rejected. |

## Using the UI

- **Session browser** — filter sessions by provider, open a session, and copy its refs for use with `sivtr show`.
- **Search** — press `/` anywhere to focus the search box; choose BM25, semantic, or hybrid ranking. BM25 is ranked per source; `source=all` concatenates the agent list then the terminal list.
- **Usage and activity** — the dashboard shows catalog-priced token usage, unpriced events, archive counts, and active days.

## JSON API

The same surface is available as a read-only JSON API:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/health` | Server health check |
| `GET /api/v1/providers` | List registered providers |
| `GET /api/v1/sessions?provider=&limit=&offset=` | List sessions with optional filters |
| `GET /api/v1/sessions/{provider}/{session_id}` | One full session |
| `GET /api/v1/search?q=&source=all\|all:agent\|all:terminal\|<selector>&limit=&semantic=&hybrid=` | BM25, semantic, or hybrid search |
| `GET /api/v1/usage?provider=&session_id=&since=&until=` | Token usage and costs |
| `GET /api/v1/stats?provider=&since=&until=` | Activity, outcomes, projects, privacy, and usage statistics |

## Privacy

The server binds loopback only (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`). Non-loopback `--host` values are rejected, so the unauthenticated UI cannot be exposed on the network. The HTTP API is read-only; startup may refresh the local archive via `ensure_fresh()`. With a loopback bind, data never leaves the machine. The server also validates the browser `Host` header to guard against DNS rebinding.

Changing `--port` also changes the accepted `Host`, so requests must target the same `host:port` the server is bound to.

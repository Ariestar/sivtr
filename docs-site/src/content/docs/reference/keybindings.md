This page documents the workspace picker TUI (the default `sivtr` interface). The single-buffer browser that `pipe`/`run`/`import` used was removed — those commands now write to history and open the external editor.

## Workspace picker

`pipe`/`run`/`import` no longer open a TUI; the picker is reached by running bare `sivtr`, via `copy --pick`, the session picker hotkey, or session import.

## Structure-block folding

Every workpart is a foldable block; tool call + result are grouped by call id. Consecutive structure units fold into a run tagged like `<:kind xN:>`.

- **`Enter`** on the cursor block — fold/unfold.
- **Single click** on a block tag — toggle it (Reading mode only; raw mode always full).
- **Double-click** (< 400ms) — fold a block.
- **`r`** — switch between read mode (markdown + fold tags) and raw mode (full payloads).

Two levels: a run tag expands to reveal its members (still folded), and a member expands to show its body. Defaults: structure blocks collapsed, body blocks expanded.

## Mouse

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Wheel | Scroll (3 lines; Content smooth-scrolls) |
| Click | Focus + select |
| Click dot gutter | Toggle a block mark |
| Drag | Linear select |
| Ctrl-drag | Block select |
| Double-click | Fold a block |
| Click a link | Open it |

## Workspace search

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Open search input |
| `Enter` | Accept search input |
| `Esc` | Clear or close search |
| `Backspace` | Edit query while input is open |
| `Ctrl-U` | Clear the query |
| `n` | Next match |
| `N` | Previous match |

Search prefixes:

| Prefix | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| none | Content |

## Line filter input

Opened from the picker with `:`. Requires at least one dialogue.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| digits, `,`, `:` | Build a 1-based line spec |
| `Backspace` | Edit pending filter |
| `Esc` | Clear/cancel |

The filter applies to the next copy shortcut (`i`/`o`/`y`/`c`) automatically. Examples: `2:8`, `1,3,8:12`.

## Vim-style full view
